When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository should be used when there are multiple physical 
    locations from which the file(s) in the repository will be changed and 
    updated.  This could be when one user makes changes from different 
    computers, such as a work and home computer, or when multiple users are 
    working on one project together, such as changing the same code or adding 
    more files to the repository.  This allows the repository to become more 
    accessible by anyone who has permission from anywhere, and will update any 
    changes for everyone involved.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
