What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, git creates a "snapshot" of the 
	current directory and all of the files within, if any.  A hidden 
	file is created which will keep track of any commits from this point 
	on.  Without it, any change to the files will occur but the previous 
	versions will be lost.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a section where final changes can be made, which will 
	stop errors happening related to commits.  If the wrong file is added or 
	omitted, the staging area will be the place to check before actually 
	finalizing the commit.  Doing so will be a good check that everything has 
	been updated properly.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
