When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository should be used when there are multiple physical 
    locations from which the file(s) in the repository will be changed and 
    updated.  This could be when one user makes changes from different 
    computers, such as a work and home computer, or when multiple users are 
    working on one project together, such as changing the same code or adding 
    more files to the repository.  This allows the repository to become more 
    accessible by anyone who has permission from anywhere, and will update any 
    changes for everyone involved.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Being able to manually pull from the GitHub remote repository allows 
	the user to know how up-to-date the local repository is.  If Git 
	automatically performed a pull to stay up-to-date, the local 
	repository would change without the user knowing which updates 
	occurred, and maybe even without knowing that it was updated at all.  
	If the user is working on a file and stops, the automatic update may 
	change the work on the local repository and lose the information, 
	essentially reverting it back to a previous version.
